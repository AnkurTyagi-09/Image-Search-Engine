# 🖼️ Image Search Engine

A simple web-based image search engine that allows users to search for images using a keyword. The application displays the search results and provides a "Show More" button to load additional images.

---

## 💡 Features

- **Image Search**: Search for images based on user input.
- **Dynamic Results Display**: Images are displayed dynamically as they are fetched.
- **Load More Functionality**: Users can load more images with a dedicated button.
- **Loading Indicator**: A visual loader is shown while images are being fetched.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application (`style.css`).
- **JavaScript**: For handling search functionality, API calls, and dynamic content updates (`script.js`).

## 📁 Project Structure

```
ImageSearchEngine/

├── style.css
└── script.js
```

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS rules for styling the application.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for handling search queries, fetching data from an image API, and updating the DOM.

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a specific image search API (e.g., Unsplash, Pixabay) for actual image fetching.
- Add error handling for API requests.
- Improve UI/UX with more advanced styling and animations.
- Implement pagination instead of just "Show More".
- Add a debounce mechanism to the search input for better performance.
